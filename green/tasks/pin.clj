;; Stamp the green payload from a clean pushed commit. Every payload is born
;; unpinned (no invented SHAs) and `bb pin` stamps or re-stamps it after a
;; clean, pushed HEAD. Each site recognises exactly two forms, its unpinned
;; birth shape and its pinned shape, and the run fails loudly when a payload
;; matches neither. Modelled on neon/green/tasks/pin.clj: one site per colour.
